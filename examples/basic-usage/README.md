## üîç **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Issue: "Command not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed:
```bash
node --version  # Should be 18+
npm --version   # Should be 8+
```

### Issue: "MCP server failed to start"
**Solutions**:
1. For local: `npm install -g @llmbase/mcp-web-fetch`
2. For hosted: Check your internet connection
3. Restart Claude Desktop

### Issue: "No response from server"  
**Solutions**:
1. Test with a simple request first
2. Check if the URL is accessible
3. Try a different deployment mode

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solutions**:
1. Wait 1 minute and try again (hosted service)
2. Use local deployment for unlimited requests
3. Batch smaller sets of URLs

## üìä **Expected Response Times**

| Deployment | Single URL | 5 URLs | 20 URLs |
|------------|------------|--------|---------|
| **Hosted** | <500ms | <2s | <5s |
| **Local** | <1s | <3s | <8s |  
| **Self-Hosted** | <200ms | <1s | <3s |

*Times may vary based on target website response times*
